# Run examples

Default is to run provided examples which are a subset of [Khronos models examples](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models).

It's possible to run external examples by providing absolute path to examples as desktop launcher first argument.

Example with Khronos models : 

	$ git clone https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models.git
	$ ./gdx-gltf-demo.jar glTF-Sample-Models/2.0


BatchTest can be configured the same way to process a different model set.
